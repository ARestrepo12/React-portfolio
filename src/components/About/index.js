                As a recent graduate from North Carolina State University with a degree in Nutrition Science, I originally went in search for experience in a hospital setting to start my journey towards becoming a registered dietician when I realized that career wasnt for me. As I continued working at Duke Raleigh Hospital, I turned my attention towards getting into the coding field as I am a great trouble shooter, someone who learns fast, and has patience. As I near my graduation from the Full-Stack Development bootcamp at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, I realize that I am really enjoying what I do now and made the right choice.
